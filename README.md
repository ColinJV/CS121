# Programming Assignment Demos

In this branch are projects made to demonstrate solutions to various programming assignments given in a Program Design & Development in C class that I worked as a TA for. This course is designed for absolute beginners to programming and covers basic C syntax and data types, functions and functional decomposition and the function call stack, basic file IO processing in C using library functions, selection structures and conditional logic, loops and iterative logic, pointers and modular programming, arrays including searching and sorting, strings and basic string processing, structures and objects in C, recursion, bit operations, and an introduction to dynamic data structures and linked list operations.

At various times I observed that my students were relying heavily on functions defined for them in the assignment document or not maximally decomposing their projects into functions, or making various other errors common to beginners. Rather than address each student one by one, I have found it more productive to build projects that solve the problems of the assignment using techniques that are at the students' skill levels so that they can more completelely understand more sophisticated approaches within the context of their level of knowledge.

While these projects do not use techniques beyond those taught in this course, and are therefore sometimes not optimal for a completely unrestricted solution to the assignment's problem, they are a good reflection of what I would consider A quality work if submitted by one of my students.

Each folder contains a .pdf of the assignment document and a Visual Studio solution for the assignment.
