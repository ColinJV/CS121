# Assignments and Labs for CS121
This repository contains lab and programming assignments for my introductory programming course in C.

## Labs
Lab solutions were generated by me after taking this course when I worked as a TA, and are provided to students as examples for how they might have solved the problems. Lab solutions are written to be understood by students at the level of skill consistent with the assignment. As the course advances, the quality of the code improves accordingly. This is by design as an educational asset.
